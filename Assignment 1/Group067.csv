In one embodiment an electronically signed document is removed from an electronic signature server after signed copies of the document are distributed to all signatories. The electronic signature server optionally retains an encrypted copy of the signed document, but does not retain the decryption password. This limits the amount of data retained by the electronic signature server, making it a less attractive target for hackers. However, the electronic signature server still maintains audit data that can be used to identify a signed document and validate an electronic signature. For example, a hash of the document (or other document metadata) can be used to validate the authenticity of an electronically signed document based on a logical association between an electronic signature and the signed document."

Then, to optimally change respective currents in the electromagnets in accordance with a mounting posture of the magnetic bearing, a correction coefficient arithmetic operator calculates a correction gain instruction value acting on the electromagnets from the steady-state current values squared/added up. Then, a gain instruction value obtained by adding the correction gain instruction value to a fundamental gain of a control circuit for the electromagnets is input to a gain amplifier. The gain amplifier generates a corrected current instruction value on the basis of the gain instruction value and optimally controls the magnetic bearing."
